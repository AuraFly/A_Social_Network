# A_Social_Network

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description:

My Challenge this week is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

There will be no front end, so this will need to be ran through node, and tested using insomnia.
